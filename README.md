# Project Title  
This repository contains a PDF report for the project [PROJECT AKHIR DATA ANALYST Reservation Optimization].  

## Overview  
The Reservation Optimization project focused on improving Resort Hotel reservations which were 11.4% lower than City Hotel. Through data analysis and visualization, the team identified strategies such as stricter cancellation policies, seasonal adjustments to daily rates, improved food facilities, and promotions in the peak holiday season (July-August). The implementation of these recommendations successfully increased reservations by 11.4% in 3 months, with optimization based on customer segmentation, seasonal trends, and dominant booking channels.
